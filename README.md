I'm aiming to make catching all the creatures in Animal Crossing: New Horizons easier for everyone with this project! It (currently) shows all fish & bugs but if more are added I'm happy to add them to the website/project! If you sign up, you'll also be able to save, favorite and see if the current creature is available to catch!

## üå± What technologies am I using for this project?
This project uses the awesome Animal Crossing API: http://acnhapi.com. It makes all creatures and more available, and so it makes it easier to maintain this project!

It is also made with the Vue.js framework to make it a SPA, a Mongo Database and more! I'm open to answer questions!

## üçë What are my future plans with this project?
I'm looking to keep this project up to date at all times, or maybe as long as the game or the community keep this game alive! If you would like to help me support this project or more of my future projects, it would be awesome if you'd buy me a [hot chocolate](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/soryn) or donate directly through [PayPal](https://www.paypal.me/soryyyn) to help keep this project free for as many people as possible!
